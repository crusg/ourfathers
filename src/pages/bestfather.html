        						<h1>Knowing God, the Father</h1>
        						<p>The stories of Edgar, Mark, David and Jason tell of their personal struggles and failures, despite their best efforts to succeed at being fathers. As varied as their personal accounts are, one thing rings true––their stories point us to God, the Father who loves unconditionally, who never lets go of his children, who gives sacrificially and who is ever-present in his children’s lives.</p>

<p>In the Christian faith, God reveals himself as a Father through several contexts, the most important being that of a spiritual Father. </p>

<p>We experience God as the Father through Jesus. Through Jesus we receive the Father’s love and are called “children of God”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, "When you pray, you say, 'Our Father.'" He has given to us the right and privilege to come into the presence of the majesty of God and address him as Father because indeed he is our Father. God has adopted us into his family and made us co-heirs with his only begotten Son (Rom. 8:17).</p>

<p>Being his children means Christians experience a God who expresses all the qualities of a loving Father––one who gives life, who loves us, rewards our efforts, communicates with us, disciplines us. Most importantly, he will grant us the ultimate gift of life—eternal life in his Kingdom through his grace (Roman 6:23; Ephesians 2:5)—if we repent of our sins and obey his commands (Acts 2:38).</p>

<p>If you have not yet experienced God as a personal, caring, loving Father, there is an opportunity to do so––to know God, the Father. For more information about who God is and how you can become a child of God, be sure to check out <a href="/">TheFour.sg</a></p>
