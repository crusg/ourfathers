						<h3><em>As a husband and father, you are the warrior who has been charged with the duty of pushing back against the evil that seeks to prey on your wife, daughters, and sons. If you don’t step up, who will?</em></h3>
						<p>It began as a shopping date with my daughter Laura, who was 13 at the time. I never dreamed it would end the way it did.</p>

<p>Laura decided that she wanted to go where her older brothers and sisters went to shop at the time—Abercrombie and Fitch. There she found a beautiful baby blue sweater, and she went to the dressing room to try it on. While I was waiting I noticed a life-sized poster of a young man completely nude, leaning up on a boat dock knee deep in water. The shot was from behind, but I had not asked to see that guy chilling in his birthday suit.</p>
<p>I stood there looking at that poster thinking that I thought this was a clothing store and how inappropriate that was for my daughter and other girls. Finally I asked if I could please talk with the manager. The young man, who couldn’t have been over 30, came over and I greeted him with a smile. I shared with him that I had six children and was a good customer; then I said very kindly, "This picture … I'm sorry, but it's just indecent."  I thought I’d get agreement.</p>
<p>Instead he quipped, "I beg to differ with you, sir. By whose standards?" </p><q class="pull-quote">He looked at the picture, then my daughter, and back at me. He looked like a deer in the headlights.</q>
<p>A little stunned by his response, I replied with measured firmness, "By any standard of real morality." </p>
<p>By that time, Laura had wandered back with her sweater. I pointed to the picture of the chiseled, buff-buddy’s buns, looked the manager squarely in the eyes, and said, "Sir, if that picture is not indecent, then I'd like you to drop your pants and get in a similar pose to that guy in the picture." </p>
<p>He looked at the picture, then my daughter, and back at me. He looked like a deer in the headlights. There was a moment of silence, full of anticipation. Then he shook his head and said, "Huh-uh."</p>
<p>I probably shouldn’t have pressed the point, but I added, "Come on, you said that picture is not indecent. Come on, drop 'em."</p>
	<p>"Huh-uh."</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "You know, it's a good thing you didn't drop your pants, because you could have been arrested for indecent exposure."  </p>
<p>Then he replied, "Well, if you think that's bad, you should see our catalog." </p>
<p>So I went over and opened the catalog. One photo showed four teenage girls in bed with a boy; I’m not sure what they were advertising—maybe bedsheets—because none of them had clothes on. I pushed the catalog back and said, "I'd like you to take my name and phone number. I'd like someone from your corporate office to give me a call." </p>
<p>To which he politely said, "Sir, I can take your name and address but they're not interested. They really don't care what you think."</p>
<p>My response was kind, but firm: "I just want you to know I'm just one customer. I'm just a daddy of six kids, but I've got a lot of friends. And I want you to know that wherever I go, I'm going to use this episode as an illustration of a company that doesn't care about the future of our young people, their morality, or the future of our nation."</p>
<p>I figure I’ve shared the story with about five million people on various radio broadcasts, speaking at conferences, and in writing.</p>
<h2>The courage to protect</h2>
<p>One of my favorite quotes, attributed to British politician Edmund Burke, is “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.” When evil invades a man’s life and marriage, his children’s lives, his work, and his community, the easiest thing for him to do is nothing. </p>
<p>As a husband and father, you are the warrior who has been charged with the duty of pushing back against the evil that seeks to prey on your wife, daughters, and sons. If you don’t step up, who will?</p>
